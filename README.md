## STAT196K-final-project
This is the final project for my STAT196K class. The requirements are to use one of the technologies we learned during this semester, I am choosing to use AWS, although will probably also be using SQL, large datasets, and complex datasets.

## Goals
I want to be able to use the ImageAI package in Python to be able to determine the amount of cars in CalTrans live cameras. Using this data I should be able to show current levels of traffic congestion at these locations. I want to be able to store this data in S3 for analysis to be made of historical congestion levels.
